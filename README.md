# Image-Steganography

In this project, I used concept of image steganography and implemented it using python programming language.
You can use this app to share any details or other private stuff from one person to another by encoding the secret message in the image and then sharing the image.
You can also use this app for decoding the secret message stored in the image.

Note:-
I strictly recommend, using a .png image.
It may work with other types of images but, there'll some side-effects, such as, image distortion or b/w image, etc.

I'll improve it with time, still anyone have any ideas, contact me or leave a comment.
