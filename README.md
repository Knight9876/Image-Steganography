# Welcome to Image-Steganography
ImageSteg is a Python application for image steganography, allowing users to encode text into images and decode text from encoded images. With its simple interface, users can seamlessly hide and reveal messages within images.

# Features:
1. Encoding:
Encode Text into Image: Choose an image file and enter the text you wish to encode. ImageSteg will embed the text into the selected image.
Generate Encoded Image: Upon encoding, a new image file with the ".enc.png" extension will be generated, indicating that it contains encoded text.
2. Decoding:
Decode Text from Encoded Image: Select an encoded image file (with the ".enc.png" extension) to reveal the hidden text embedded within the image.
Display Decoded Text: ImageSteg displays the decoded text on the screen, allowing users to utilize or copy it for future use.

# Getting Started:
1. Launch the App: Run the ImageSteg Python script to launch the application.
2. Select Operation:
Choose between "Encode" or "Decode" options.
I. Encoding:
If "Encode" is selected:
Choose an image file for encoding.
Enter the text to be hidden in the image.
Upon encoding, a new image file with the encoded text will be generated.
II. Decoding:
If "Decode" is selected:
Choose the encoded image file (with the ".enc.png" extension).
The hidden text will be decoded and displayed on the screen.

# Note
I strictly recommend, using a .png image.
It may work with other types of images but, there'll some side-effects, such as, image distortion or b/w image, etc.
I'll improve it with time, still anyone have any ideas, contact me or leave a comment.
